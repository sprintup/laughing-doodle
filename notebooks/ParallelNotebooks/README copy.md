#  Parallelizing Deep Learning using MPI and GPU

Implemented a sequential and parallel neural network model using data based parallelism in Python using MPI and GPU computing. Measured the improvement in performance and speed up in training time.

 * `mnist-nn.py`: 3-layer neural network as digit recognizer (MNIST).
 * `mnist-nn-gpu.py`: mnist-nn with GPU computing.
 * `mnist-nn-data-parallelism.py`: mnist-nn with data parallelism (MPI and GPU).
